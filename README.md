# CS106A - Programming Methodology

This repository contains my work and notes for **CS106A: Programming Methodology**, a course offered by Stanford University. The course introduces fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques using the Java programming language.

## About the Course
CS106A is designed for beginners with little to no prior programming experience. It focuses on:

- Fundamental programming constructs (variables, conditionals, loops)
- Methods and functional decomposition
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Data structures (arrays, collections, objects)
- Problem-solving strategies and debugging
- Good programming style and software design practices

## Repository Structure
- `assignments/` – Solutions to course assignments
- `examples/` – Example programs and practice problems
- `notes/` – Personal notes and summaries from lectures
- `projects/` – Larger programming projects completed during the course

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CS106A-Programming-Methodology.git
